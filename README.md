# Retail Conversions from January - March 2020

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
List of 26 unique customers purchasing items to earn ecommerce points, logic in [App.js](./src/App.js) runs through [this made up data source](https://v1.nocodeapi.com/mwuebben/google_sheets/WoXCAYgBorCCCsgm?tabId=Sheet1).
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction

(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
